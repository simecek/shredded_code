Before you start, you need to register at [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/) and ask for a free trial. Copy Face-Preview API key into an environment  variable `faceKEY` as follows `Sys.setenv(faceKEY = "***YOUR*KEY***")`. Here, I will demonstrate Face API on my Twitter profile picture:

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/420950459289833472/JtRoD1cw_400x400.jpeg)


```{r}
library(httr)
 
faceURL = "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0/detect?returnFaceAttributes=age,gender,smile,facialHair"
img.url = "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/420950459289833472/JtRoD1cw_400x400.jpeg"

faceKEY = Sys.getenv("faceKEY")
 
mybody = list(url = img.url)
 
faceResponse = POST(
  url = faceURL, 
  content_type('application/json'), add_headers(.headers = c('Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' = faceKEY)),
  body = mybody,
  encode = 'json'
)

# status ok = 200
faceResponse$status
```

All information about a picture is now easily accesible by applying the function `content`.

```{r}
content(faceResponse)
```

For example happiness or beardiness can be extracted as follows.

```{r}
content(faceResponse)[[1]]$faceAttributes$smile
content(faceResponse)[[1]]$faceAttributes$facialHair$beard
```
